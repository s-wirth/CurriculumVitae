        I am a Release and Deployment Manager working in London. After being
        employed in engineering for a few years, I made this transition because
        I knew that only the right processes, structures and mindset can really
        enable engineers and thereby tech-companies to achieve their full
        potential. Getting great products from development into production is a
        challenge, especially for Start Ups and one that I am passionate about.

          have thrived and improved drastically. As I was working before in
